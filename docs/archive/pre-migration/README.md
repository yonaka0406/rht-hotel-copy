## Migration Information

These files have been migrated to the new documentation structure. See `../redirect-mappings.json` for the mapping of old locations to new locations.

### Why These Files Were Archived

1. **Content Migrated**: All valuable content has been consolidated into the new docs/ structure
2. **Improved Organization**: Content is now organized by topic and audience
3. **Better Navigation**: New structure provides clearer navigation and discoverability
4. **Reduced Clutter**: Root directory is cleaner and more focused on project essentials

## Accessing Migrated Content

To find the migrated content, refer to:
- Main documentation index: `../README.md`
- Redirect mappings: `../redirect-mappings.json`
- Architecture docs: `../architecture/`
- API docs: `../api/`
- Integration docs: `../integrations/`

## Restoration

If you need to restore any of these files, they are preserved here in their original form. However, we recommend using the new documentation structure as it provides better organization and maintainability.
