## 2025-05-22 - [Unified Reservation Blocks with Indicator Strips]
**Learning:** In dense calendar grid views, merging consecutive reservation days into a single block improves visual clarity and allows for sticky headers (keeping guest names visible). To keep interactions date-aware without shifting the layout, use absolute-positioned overlay segments.
**Action:** Use unified blocks for consecutive stays and represent plan/status changes with a side indicator strip. Ensure segments are absolutely positioned to maintain grid alignment despite sticky headers.
